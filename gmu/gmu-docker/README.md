Place the gmu utility and jar files here. Rename the GatewayMigrationUtility.sh to gmu.
Contents of this directory:
```
README.md			# this README file
gmu				# the GMU script renamed
lib				# contains jars required by GMU
GatewayMigrationUtility.jar	# the main GMU jar
```
Note: The GMU tool is ignored by .gitignore since it is non-sharable and usage is tied with license.
